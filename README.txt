DESCRIPTION

This program was devised to accomplish two goals: Implement a Radix Sort on Array,
and evaluate an expression in Postfix notation using stack.

INSTALLATION
(Make sure to properly extract the program before running)

In order to properly run this program I would recommend first opening it in an IDE
(Such as the default one that come with Python, or PyCharm). Then you will want to
"Run" the file, this particular part varies from IDEs. To do this in IDLE You simply
need to save the file and press 'F4' (though you will need to hold the 'Fn" key if you
are using a laptop).

The results of the run should open in a seperate window or in a subsection of the IDE
(again this varies between IDEs)

LICESNE AND AUTHOR INFO

The functions "radixSort" and "postFixConvert" were written exclusively by me
(Jacob Williams). However, the classes "ArrayStack" and "ArrayQueue" were both imported from 
the in class examples due to the fact that their utiliztion was required for the 
assignment.
